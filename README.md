## Hi everyone! 👋

My name is Jaclyn and I am currently a graduate student at Utica University, studying data science and business analytics 📈. I also work full time as a Senior Revenue Analyst for healthcare and revenue cycle management⚕️.

I am interested in developing my analytics skills in order to help elevate the work that my team can do, so we can better help the company reach its goals!

-🔭I'm currently working on: developing visuals that effectively and efficiently communicate information, that tell stories with data.

-🌱I'm currently learning: Tableau and refreshing Python and R skills.

-⚡Fun fact: I am also very crafty and own a small business making reversible octopus stuffed animals 🐙 based on video game 🎮 characters !
